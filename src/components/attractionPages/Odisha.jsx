        <p>2.Chandipur beach - odisha
Chandipur is a beach like no other. During low tides the beach recedes upto 5 KM offering visitors the opportunity to walk on the sea bed. This unique phenomenon helps the beach to support its equally unique biodiversity.It is home to the endangered horse shoe crabs, star fish, sea urchins to name a few. The water of the beach is muddy making it unsuited for bathing.
Things to do:-
While walking on the sea bed during low tides always ensure that you heed the advice of the locals for the water comes rushing in during high tides
The confluence of the Buddhbalanga River is a scenic spot and popular amongst locals a picnic spot.
The Panchalingeswara temple located 41KM from Chandipur is a revered temple of the region.</p>
